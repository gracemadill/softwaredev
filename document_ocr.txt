2. Help at home

Sometimes a little bit of helo can make coping at home
easier. Here are some ideas that can make the first few days
or weeks at home after a hospital stay easier.

Have you let your neighbours know you are home?

They may be able to help with things like putting your bins out
or bringing them in again, emptying your mailbox, bringing the
paper in or dog walking.

Do your friends and family know you are home?

Visitors can lift your mood and help with small tasks around
the house. You can catch up via a video call or telephone call
if you are not up to visitors.

Do you need help with household tasks, shopping or
preparing healthy meals?

Family and friends are often happy to help by providing meals
or dropping off groceries.

There are also services that can help with this, either short
or long term. You may need to wait until services can be
arranged.

You can contact the Seniors Information Service provided by
COTA ACT on 02 6282 3777 for information about services.

If you are under 65 you may be able to get help through
the ACT Government Community Assistance and Support
Program (CASP).

Do you need help looking after your pets?

Pets are important for wellbeing and mental health, but you
might have some problems looking after them. Could your
pet stay with friends or family for a couple of weeks? Could a
neighbour’s child clean the bird cage for you, or take the dog
for a walk for some pocket money?

Do you need help getting to appointments?

How will you get to and from appointments? Can a friend
or family member take you? Can you organise Community
Transport? Are you eligible for subsidised taxi travel?

3. Preventing falls at home

If you have had a fall, soeak to your GP so you can take steps
to reduce your risk of falling again.

If you have a fall at home, you can call an ambulance if you can’t get up or
your carer can’t help you up. They can help and will check that you haven’t
injured anything. You do not have to go to hospital after calling an
ambulance.

There are simple steps you can take to prevent slips, trips, and falls:

Take care of your health. Make sure you eat and drink well
and take your medication as recommended.

¢ Avoid dehydration. Make sure you drink regularly, even if
you aren’t thirsty. Dehydration can affect your balance.

¢ Make sure you are eating enough. Your body needs lots of
energy and nutrients to heal and be well. Low blood sugar
or constipation can stop you thinking clearly.

¢ Notice how medication affects you. If your medication
makes you drowsy, dizzy, weak, confused, or affects your
balance, tell your doctor so they can make any changes
needed.

¢ Check your eyesight. Have your eyes tested regularly and
make sure you keep your glasses somewhere easy to reach.

Move your body. Moving will improve your balance,
strengthen your muscles and bones, and improve your overall
fitness and wellbeing.

¢ Build your balance. Improving your balance is an important
way to prevent a fall.

¢ Strengthen your legs. Strong bones and muscles in your
legs will help keep you flexible and mobile.

e Use a mobility aid, such as a walking stick or walking
frame - if one has been recommended. You will need to
build your strength, balance and mobility up slowly.

Remove hazards. Keeping your home free from hazards will
reduce your risk of a fall.

¢ Make your home safer. Remove slip and trip hazards like
rugs, power cords, and small pieces of furniture. Make sure
areas are well lit. Consider home modifications if you might
need them like ramps or handrails.

¢ Home maintenance. Fix any uneven surfaces, such as
broken paths, wobbly pavers or rotten boards in decks or
stairs.

¢ Wear safe footwear. Wear flat, securely fitting shoes with
good grip.

4. Be medicine-wise at home

Keep a list of all the medicines you take, including over-the-
counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal medicines. Keep it up
to date. Make sure it is easy to find in an emergency and that
your family and carers know where it is.

* Keep medicines out of reach of children and pets.

e Ask your pharmacist to dispose of your unused or out-of-date
medicines.

e Ask your pharmacist for a list of your regular medicines. If you have
trouble remembering to take your medicines, speak to your local
pharmacist for ways they can help (for example using a Webster-pak®).

e Use an app to manage your medicine list. Your pharmacy may
recommend an app that you can use to see and manage your
prescriptions.
